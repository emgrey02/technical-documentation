                React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework - it's not 
                even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. 
                For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications; React 360 can be used to
                build virtual reality applications; and there are other possibilities besides.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are
                often discussed in the same spaces as - and utilized to solve the same problems as - other
                true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working
                with that colloquial understanding.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. 
                It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that 
                describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to create 
                a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on 
                the UI design.

                React uses an HTML-in-JavaScript syntax called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Familiarity with both HTML 
                and JavaScript will help you to learn JSX, and better identify whether bugs in your application 
                are related to JavaScript or to the more specific domain of React.

                Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around 
                code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for 
                them, and to adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few 
                pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an 
                application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable 
                when you build your entire app with React. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing 
                interfaces with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a 
                website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a 
                build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.

        <header>How does React use JavaScript?</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest 
                departure from JavaScript comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's 
                syntax so that HTML-like code can live alongside it. For example:

            <code>
                const heading = (h1)Mozilla Developer Network(/h1);
            </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                This heading constant is known as a JSX expression. React can use it to render that h1 tag in our app.
    
                Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a (header) tag, for semantic reasons? 
                The JSX approach allows us to nest our elements within each other, 
                just like we do with HTML:
                <code>
                    const header = (
                    (header)
                    (h1)Mozilla Developer Network(/h1)
                    (/header)
                    );
                </code>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, your browser can't read JSX without help. When compiled (using a tool like Babel 
                or Parcel), our header expression would look like this:
                <code>
                    const header = React.createElement("header", null,
  React.createElement("h1", null, "Mozilla Developer Network")
);
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                It's possible to skip the compilation step and use React.createElement() to write your UI 
                yourself. In doing this, however, you lose the declarative benefit of JSX, and your code 
                becomes harder to read. Compilation is an extra step in the development process, but many 
                developers in the React community think that the readability of JSX is worthwhile. Plus, 
                popular tooling makes the JSX-to-JavaScript compilation part of its setup process. You 
                don't have to configure compilation yourself unless you want to.

                There are many ways to use React, but we're going to use the command-line interface 
                (CLI) tool create-react-app, as mentioned earlier, which expedites the process of 
                developing a React application by installing some packages and creating some files 
                for you, handling the tooling described above. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It's possible to add React to a website without create-react-app by copying some
                (script) elements into an HTML file, but the create-react-app CLI is a common 
                starting point for React applications. Using it will allow you spend more time 
                building your app, and less time fussing with setup. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <li>
                    In order to use create-react-app, you need to have Node.js installed. It's 
                    recommended that you use the long-term support (LTS) version. Node includes 
                    npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may also use the Yarn package manager as an alternative, but we'll assume 
                    you are using npm in this set of tutorials. See Package management basics for 
                    more information on npm and yarn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you 
                    parity with Unix/macOS terminal in order to use the terminal commands mentioned 
                    in this tutorial. Gitbash (which comes as part of the git for Windows toolset) 
                    or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are both suitable. See Command line crash 
                    course for more information on these, and on terminal commands in general. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only work on a fairly 
                    modern set of browsers — IE9+ by way of some polyfills. It is recommended that you 
                    use a modern browser like Firefox, Safari, or Chrome when working through these 
                    tutorials.

                In React, a component is a reusable module that renders a part of our app. These parts 
                can be big or small, but they are usually clearly defined: they serve a single, obvious 
                purpose.

                <code>
                    import React from 'react';
                    import logo from './logo.svg';
                    import './App.css';
                    function App() {
                </code>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Boobies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <code>
                    Boobies.
                </code>
